.Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides a chroot to run a command or a shell with more isolation,
thanks to features introduced in recent Linux kernels (2.6.24 or
later). Like
.Xr chroot 8 ,
.Nm
will change the root directory to the specified
.Ar target
before running the provided
.Ar command
but it will also provide a new PID namespace, a new mount namespace
and a new IPC namespace to ensure better isolation.
.Pp
Moreover, when the command exits, the kernel will automatically kill
any process that was started by the command, umount any filesystems
mounted by
.Nm
or the commmand and cleanup the IPC namespace. Therefore, most daemons
can be run safely from the chroot: they will be killed on exit.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl N | Fl -new-network-ns
Switch to a new network namespace. The program will be run in a fresh
network namespace. Unless additional actions are taken, this means
that the program won't get any network access.
.It Fl U | Fl -new-user-ns
Switch to a new user namespace. It allows
.Nm
to be run without being root. It requires a recent kernel (3.8+) with
support for user namespace.
.It Fl M | Fl -uid-map Ar mapping
Use the provided user-mapping in the new user namespace. This option
should not be used without The
.Fl U
option. The mapping is explained in
.Xr user_namespaces 7
manual page. A mapping is a record with the ID range start inside the
namespace, the ID range start outside the namespace and the length of
the range.
.It Fl G | Fl -gid-map Ar mapping
Use the provided group-mapping in the new user namespace. See
.Fl M
for more information.
.It Fl u | Fl -user Ar user
Specify user to use after chrooting. This can be specified as a user
name or an UID. In case of a user name, the primary group of the user
is also used unless another group is specified.
.It Fl g | Fl -group Ar group
Specify primary group to use after chrooting. This can be specified
as a group name or a GID.
.It Fl f | Fl -fstab Ar fstab
Specify a file location in the
.Xr fstab 5
format containing mount points relative to
.Ar target
to mount inside the chroot. Here is an example of such a file:
.Bd -literal
proc     /proc  proc    defaults                  0  0
sys      /sys   sysfs   defaults                  0  0
/home    /home  none    bind,rw                   0  0
/dev/pts /dev/pts none  bind,rw                   0  0
/var/run /var/run tmpfs rw,nosuid,noexec,mode=755 0  0

/etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf none bind,ro    0  0
.Ed
.It Fl n | Fl -hostname Ar name
Specify a hostname for the chroot. This enables UTS namespace.
.It Fl p | Fl -pidfile Ar file
Write PID of child process to file.
.It Fl e | Fl -env Ar name=value
Set an environment variable. This option can be specified more than once.
.It Fl c | Fl -chdir Ar directory
Change to the specified directory after entering the chroot.
.It Fl h | Fl -help
Get help.
